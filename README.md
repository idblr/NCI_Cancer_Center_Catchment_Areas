### Project details
The National Cancer Act of 1971 created a process to recognize the leadership, facilities, and research efforts at cancer centers in the United States. National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Centers define and describe a catchment area that they tailor specific scientific and community engagement activities. We geographically define and display a national map of 63 NCI-designated Cancer Center catchment areas as well as demonstrate how publicly available data sets can be linked to each catchment area. 

### R-scripts included in this repository

This repository includes R-scripts use to render the geographical figures found in the following peer-reviewed manuscript:
